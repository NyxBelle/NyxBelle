# 👾 NyxBelle | Neural Interface Builder | AI Visionary in Training

> This isn’t just code, it’s a dimensional gateway into how I think, learn, and create.

Welcome to my space on the internet. I’m **NyxBelle**, a Computer Science student blending **AI, design, and storytelling** into immersive experiences. I build future-inspired projects and tools that reflect both technical depth and creative imagination.

### 🌌 Current Mission: The Neural Realm

My personal portfolio isn’t just a site, it’s a **living 3D world**.  
Inside the Neural Realm, you’ll discover:

- 🔲 **Floating glowing cubes** as entry points into my projects
- 🧪 A **real-time AI Playground** where models come alive
- 🧠 A **Bias Detection Tool** powered by Python & machine learning
- 🖼️ Interactive canvases, glitchy research PDFs, and AI displays in digital tanks

Every interaction is a reflection of how I think, build, and evolve in the world of tech.

### 🧠 What I'm Building Now

- ⚙️ **Bias Detection Tool** – A project that flags hidden bias in datasets
- 🧬 **Neural Realm Website** – My interactive, sci-fi themed portfolio
- 💬 **AI Chatbot** – Natural language model interface
- 📊 **Machine Learning Projects** – FreeCodeCamp course on Python ML (regression, clustering, classification, etc.)
